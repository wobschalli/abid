module Rides
  # Time-optimal seat assignment — what the Auto-fill button and the bot's
  # late-rider sweep both call.
  #
  # A capacitated vehicle-routing problem: each car starts where its driver is
  # (home, or last class on a Friday), collects riders, and everyone ends at the
  # venue. The objective is total driving seconds.
  #
  # Two invariants, and they are the design:
  #
  #   Nobody a human or a dispatch has committed to ever moves. Two kinds of
  #   seating are sacred: any rider in a car whose driver has been told
  #   (queued/sent/confirmed), and any rider a coordinator placed by hand.
  #   The optimizer's OWN pre-dispatch placements are neither — it may revise
  #   itself freely until a driver has been messaged, which is what lets a
  #   re-press fix a layout the constraints have since outlawed. The tell is
  #   pickup_position: the optimizer always writes one, hand-seating never
  #   does, and a manual re-drag clears it.
  #
  #   The pool is droppable, the seated are not. Over-capacity leaves people
  #   visibly in the queue rather than failing the solve or evicting someone.
  #
  # Falls back to the greedy zone AutoFiller on ANY failure — gem missing,
  # venue unlocatable, solver infeasible — because this button gets pressed on
  # Sunday mornings and must never 500.
